# Epistemic Infrastructure

This repository contains a non-normative RFC articulating a conceptual position on large language models (LLMs) as epistemic infrastructure rather than autonomous agents or mere tools.

The materials collected here examine how such systems function as shared world models within society, and how responsibility, governance, and epistemic health emerge from their design and deployment rather than from internal agency.

This repository is intended as a conceptual workspace.
It hosts RFC-style position papers, supporting notes, and selected examples aimed at clarifying structural properties of large-scale epistemic systems, without prescribing specific regulatory or technical solutions.

## Contents

This repository is intentionally minimal at its inception.
RFCs and supporting materials will be added incrementally as positions are refined.
